# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction

This project develops a machine learning model to predict wine quality using linear regression. The implementation is performed in a Jupyter Notebook.

## 📋 Project Overview

The primary objectives of this project are:

- To predict wine quality based on physicochemical attributes.
- To utilize linear regression for predictive modeling.
- To implement the solution using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Data Analysis**: Utilizes pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Employs matplotlib for visualizing data distributions and relationships.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Implements linear regression using scikit-learn to predict wine quality.

## 🔧 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TanishaVerma-08/Wine-Quallity-Prediction.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Wine-Quallity-Prediction
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**:

   Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. Then, install the necessary libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:

   Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   Then, open the `Wine-Quality-Prediction.ipynb` file.

2. **Run the Notebook**:

   Execute the cells in the notebook to load the data, perform data analysis, visualize data distributions, and build the linear regression model to predict wine quality.

## 📝 Dataset

The `winequality-red.csv` file contains the dataset used for this project. Ensure this file is present in the project directory before running the notebook.

## ⚠️ Note

The project focuses on red wine quality prediction. Ensure that the dataset (`winequality-red.csv`) is correctly formatted and contains the necessary data for the notebook to function effectively.
